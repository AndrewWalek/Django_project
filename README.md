# Django_project

This a project that will use the Django framework to create a fully functioning web app; a blog in this case. It will be following Corey Schaefer's tutorial.
This is my first time learning Django, although I have much prior experience with Python. I am hoping to learn a lot about the basics of Django and eventually
create my own web apps.
